The likes of France, Portugal and Spain are three of our core European locations, and all provide an envious list of Top 100 Courses and towns/cities to visit.\\nThe Algarve offers over 300 days of sunshine per year, with a host of stay & play golf resorts and the lively towns of Vilamoura and Albufeira – perfect for groups looking for a good night out. Similarly, the Costa del Sol, often referred to as Costa del Golf, is a haven for holiday-makers with a list of must-visit destinations, including Marbella, Sotogrande and Malaga, as well as over 70 golf courses along this stretch of beautiful coastline. For a more secluded, island lifestyle, then we’d recommend travelling slightly further to Majorca or the Canary Islands.\\nJust across the channel, the small, charming town of Le Touquet is possibly our stand-out golf tour location. The town centre is a great base with a nearby beach, an eclectic mix of bars and restaurants, and a selection of the best courses in the country all within close proximity of one another – namely Golf d’Hardelot, Golf du Touquet and Belle Dune. If you’d prefer a more envious climate, then Southern France dovetails golf and gastronomy with sun-kissed courses.\\nFor pristine beaches, all-inclusive resorts, dramatic coastal courses and water sports, then very few locations in the world come close to Mauritius or the Caribbean. Both destinations are perfect for some winter sun, and with food and drink often included in the cost, you don’t have to worry about spending a penny at the resort.\\nTo follow in the footsteps of the game’s top professionals, then we would highly recommend a trip to either the United Arab Emirates or USA. The UAE hosts three European Tour events a year in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, whilst the US is littered with PGA Tour and Major championship courses. To the East, play all your Florida Swing favourites such as TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill, and to the West, take on one of the most formidable layout in the world - Pebble Beach.\\nTo pair your golf with bucket-list experiences, we’d highly recommended South Africa or Thailand. We offer some exceptional tailor-made packages in South Africa where visitors can add vineyard tours and safari to their trip, as well as a visit to Cape Town city centre. Egypt offers a cultural treat where you can experience luxurious Egyptian hospitality and incredible golf with magnificent views of the Red Sea. Thailand itself offers a range of incredibly diverse destinations. Bangkok is ideal for those looking for a busy sightseeing holiday, whilst Phuket and Hua Hin are much more relaxing locations with first-class hotels, courses, and some of the most picturesque beaches in the world.\\nAs the world's #1 rated golf tour operator with over 25 years’ experience sending more than 3.5 million golfers away, Golfbreaks is one of the world’s longest established and most trusted golf travel companies. We organise golf breaks, holidays and tournament experiences at over 2,000 resorts and golf courses in the UK, Europe, and further afield.\",\n",

       " 'https://www.golfbreaks.com/en-gb/tournaments/the-masters/': '\\n\\t\\tGet first-hand reviews and the latest travel trends with the Golf Travel Experts.\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUSA\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nThu 9 Apr 2026 - Sun 12 Apr 2026\\nIf you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to experience the thrill of The Masters first-hand, then look no further. We’ve got a fantastic selection of Masters 2026 packages that can help make your dreams of visiting Augusta a reality. So, what are you waiting for? Here\\'s why you should be attending The Masters with Golfbreaks!\\nOne of the world’s most iconic and beloved sporting events, the Masters is a golf tournament like no other. Played out every April on Alister MacKenzie’s defining course design, Augusta National provides the perfect amphitheatre to watch the top professionals battle it out on the most recognisable course in the world.\\nThe players lucky enough to be invited compete not for money or ranking points, but for the glory of a Major win, membership of a very elite club, and the right to wear the coveted Green Jacket.\\nJust the merest mention of Augusta National Golf Club is enough to send most golfers into a daze. From the brilliant white sand bunkers and emerald fairways to the banks of glorious azaleas behind iconic holes like 12 and 13, this former plant nursery is an explosion of colour.\\nAnd because it’s played at the same venue every year, it’s a course that we all know intimately despite never having set foot on the hallowed turf. We can visualise every hole and the great moments that have shaped the tournament’s history - Bubba’s wedge, Tiger’s chip, Sandy’s bunker shot, Jack’s putt, right the way back to Gene Sarazen’s ‘Shot heard around the world’. Defining shots are all etched into Masters folklore, and each year new chapters are added as the roars echo around Amen Corner.\\nTo make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience, it’s important to know the best days to attend the Masters. While most of the drama might be on the final two days, many of our customers prefer to opt for the quieter rounds as they can often be a better, more relaxed viewing experience.\\nMasters tournament schedule:\\nExtend your stay to the Masters\\nTo make the most of your trip over to the States, we’d highly recommend extending your Masters package to play some of the amazing golf on offer within driving distance. There is nothing quite like watching the world’s best players in the world apply their trade, before heading out and playing some golf yourself. Although it can often be a much-needed reality check!\\nThe first-class golfing destinations of Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head, and Kiawah Island are within reaching distance of Augusta, and are the perfect way to squeeze as much out of your 2026 Masters package as possible.\\nTo further your bucket-list experience, play former major and Ryder Cup venue - Kiawah Island in South Carolina. This is a stunning stay-and-play resort offers two accommodation options and four golf courses, including the famous Ocean Course, meaning you’ll never have to leave the premises to have a great time.\\nGolf fans may remember this first-class venue from the 1991 Ryder Cup when Team USA narrowly held off Team Europe thanks to a missed six-foot putt by Bernhard Langer. 30 years later, Kiawah Island was also the scene for Phil Mickelson’s epic win here at the 2021 PGA Championship when he became the oldest player to win a major.\\nElsewhere in South Carolina are the golf rich areas of Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head. The former is often considered the Golf Capital of the World, with over 90 courses stretched out over this iconic coastline.\\nThe latter is a beautiful beachfront resort town renowned for its beaches, water sports, cycling, and most importantly, golf. There are plenty of golf resorts and courses to choose from, especially Harbour Town Golf Links, which is the home of the PGA TOUR’s annual RBC Heritage contest.\\nTalk to our specialised team and they can put together tailor-made packages suited to your preference and budget.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhether you\\'d like to attend the Masters for one day or every day, your package with us is entirely customisable.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOur dedicated and experienced on-site team will ensure your trip runs smoothly.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWith an exciting city centre, Columbia has a great range of restaurants, and hotels, and could provide the perfect base during your stay.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe offer a wide range of accommodation and golf in the USA, so why not extend your stay or add a couple of rounds of golf?\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nWe have a team dedicated to making every tournament experience an unforgettable one.\\nWhether it’s your first tournament or your 100th, our team will guide you every step of the way. They’ll use first-hand knowledge to help you experience the world’s best golf tournaments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tThe Golfbreaks team are on hand to answer any questions about Golfbreaks destinations, Amateur Events and Tournament Experiences.\\n\\t\\nGet ready for an unforgettable trip to Augusta with our Sunday ticket package. This carefully crafted itinerary balances world-class golf, local exploration, and the electric atmosphere of Masters Sunday. Want to personalise your trip? We can tailor your package to fit your perfect Masters experience.\\nThursday, 9th April – Arrival & downtown exploration\\nFriday, 10th April – Discover South Carolina\\nSaturday, 11th April – Play & watch golf\\nSunday, 12th April – Masters tournament day\\nMonday, 13th April – Departure or extended stay\\nThe city of Augusta is bustling during Masters’ week, so you won\\'t regret spending a day or an evening here. As the home of soul singer James Brown, you can enjoy live music at almost every turn inspired by himself and other greats. If you’re looking for a bite to eat too, you should definitely try T-Bonz Steakhouse – and possibly get some insights from caddies who frequent there – as well as the Frog Hollow Tavern, Farmhaus, and Calverts. You will most probably find John Daly with his bus set up outside of Hooters, for photo and autograph opportunities. If you’re extremely lucky, he may even play a few songs.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"What can you say! Just to see Augusta in person is staggering, you have to be here to physically see how impressive it is. This was an absolute bucket list trip for me and the whole setup has been entirely seamless and helped make a dream a reality \"\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t2019 Masters Attendee\\n\\t\\t\\nWe offer experiences to suit everyone.

      "You don’t have to travel too far to experience exceptional golf holiday destinations. The likes of France, Portugal and Spain are three of our core European locations, and all provide an envious list of Top 100 Courses and towns/cities to visit. The Algarve offers over 300 days of sunshine per year, with a host of stay & play golf resorts and the lively towns of Vilamoura and Albufeira – perfect for groups looking for a good night out. Similarly, the Costa del Sol, often referred to as Costa del Golf, is a haven for holiday-makers with a list of must-visit destinations, including Marbella, Sotogrande and Malaga, as well as over 70 golf courses along this stretch of beautiful coastline. For a more secluded, island lifestyle, then we’d recommend travelling slightly further to Majorca or the Canary Islands. Just across the channel, the small, charming town of Le Touquet is possibly our stand-out golf tour location. The town centre is a great base with a nearby beach, an eclectic mix of bars and restaurants, and a selection of the best courses in the country all within close proximity of one another – namely Golf d’Hardelot, Golf du Touquet and Belle Dune. If you’d prefer a more envious climate, then Southern France dovetails golf and gastronomy with sun-kissed courses. For pristine beaches, all-inclusive resorts, dramatic coastal courses and water sports, then very few locations in the world come close to Mauritius or the Caribbean. Both destinations are perfect for some winter sun, and with food and drink often included in the cost, you don’t have to worry about spending a penny at the resort. To follow in the footsteps of the game’s top professionals, then we would highly recommend a trip to either the United Arab Emirates or USA. The UAE hosts three European Tour events a year in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, whilst the US is littered with PGA Tour and Major championship courses. To the East, play all your Florida Swing favourites such as TPC Sawgrass and Bay Hill, and to the West, take on one of the most formidable layout in the world - Pebble Beach. To pair your golf with bucket-list experiences, we’d highly recommended South Africa or Thailand. We offer some exceptional tailor-made packages in South Africa where visitors can add vineyard tours and safari to their trip, as well as a visit to Cape Town city centre. Egypt offers a cultural treat where you can experience luxurious Egyptian hospitality and incredible golf with magnificent views of the Red Sea. Thailand itself offers a range of incredibly diverse destinations. Bangkok is ideal for those looking for a busy sightseeing holiday, whilst Phuket and Hua Hin are much more relaxing locations with first-class hotels, courses, and some of the most picturesque beaches in the world.

      "If you’ve ever wondered what it would be like to experience the thrill of The Masters first-hand, then look no further. We’ve got a fantastic selection of Masters 2026 packages that can help make your dreams of visiting Augusta a reality. So, what are you waiting for? Here's why you should be attending The Masters with Golfbreaks! One of the world’s most iconic and beloved sporting events, the Masters is a golf tournament like no other. Played out every April on Alister MacKenzie’s defining course design, Augusta National provides the perfect amphitheatre to watch the top professionals battle it out on the most recognisable course in the world. The players lucky enough to be invited compete not for money or ranking points, but for the glory of a Major win, membership of a very elite club, and the right to wear the coveted Green Jacket. Just the merest mention of Augusta National Golf Club is enough to send most golfers into a daze. From the brilliant white sand bunkers and emerald fairways to the banks of glorious azaleas behind iconic holes like 12 and 13, this former plant nursery is an explosion of colour. And because it’s played at the same venue every year, it’s a course that we all know intimately despite never having set foot on the hallowed turf. We can visualise every hole and the great moments that have shaped the tournament’s history - Bubba’s wedge, Tiger’s chip, Sandy’s bunker shot, Jack’s putt, right the way back to Gene Sarazen’s ‘Shot heard around the world’. Defining shots are all etched into Masters folklore, and each year new chapters are added as the roars echo around Amen Corner. To make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience, it’s important to know the best days to attend the Masters. While most of the drama might be on the final two days, many of our customers prefer to opt for the quieter rounds as they can often be a better, more relaxed viewing experience.

      "Extend your stay to the Masters\n",
      "To make the most of your trip over to the States, we’d highly recommend extending your Masters package to play some of the amazing golf on offer within driving distance. There is nothing quite like watching the world’s best players in the world apply their trade, before heading out and playing some golf yourself. Although it can often be a much-needed reality check! The first-class golfing destinations of Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head, and Kiawah Island are within reaching distance of Augusta, and are the perfect way to squeeze as much out of your 2026 Masters package as possible. To further your bucket-list experience, play former major and Ryder Cup venue - Kiawah Island in South Carolina. This is a stunning stay-and-play resort offers two accommodation options and four golf courses, including the famous Ocean Course, meaning you’ll never have to leave the premises to have a great time. Golf fans may remember this first-class venue from the 1991 Ryder Cup when Team USA narrowly held off Team Europe thanks to a missed six-foot putt by Bernhard Langer. 30 years later, Kiawah Island was also the scene for Phil Mickelson’s epic win here at the 2021 PGA Championship when he became the oldest player to win a major. Elsewhere in South Carolina are the golf rich areas of Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head. The former is often considered the Golf Capital of the World, with over 90 courses stretched out over this iconic coastline. The latter is a beautiful beachfront resort town renowned for its beaches, water sports, cycling, and most importantly, golf. There are plenty of golf resorts and courses to choose from, especially Harbour Town Golf Links, which is the home of the PGA TOUR’s annual RBC Heritage contest. Talk to our specialised team and they can put together tailor-made packages suited to your preference and budget. Whether you'd like to attend the Masters for one day or every day, your package with us is entirely customisable. With an exciting city centre, Columbia has a great range of restaurants, and hotels, and could provide the perfect base during your stay. We offer a wide range of accommodation and golf in the USA, so why not extend your stay or add a couple of rounds of golf? Get ready for an unforgettable trip to Augusta with our Sunday ticket package. This carefully crafted itinerary balances world-class golf, local exploration, and the electric atmosphere of Masters Sunday. Want to personalise your trip? We can tailor your package to fit your perfect Masters experience. Thursday, 9th April – Arrival & downtown exploration\n",

      "The city of Augusta is bustling during Masters’ week, so you won't regret spending a day or an evening here. As the home of soul singer James Brown, you can enjoy live music at almost every turn inspired by himself and other greats. If you’re looking for a bite to eat too, you should definitely try T-Bonz Steakhouse – and possibly get some insights from caddies who frequent there – as well as the Frog Hollow Tavern, Farmhaus, and Calverts. You will most probably find John Daly with his bus set up outside of Hooters, for photo and autograph opportunities. If you’re extremely lucky, he may even play a few songs. \"What can you say! Just to see Augusta in person is staggering, you have to be here to physically see how impressive it is. This was an absolute bucket list trip for me and the whole setup has been entirely seamless and helped make a dream a reality \"\n",

      "The annual RBC Heritage is South Carolina’s esteemed event on the PGA TOUR. Held every year after the Masters in the stunning region of Hilton Head Island, this well-known tournament has a steep history that spans over five decades. Since becoming one of eight new PGA TOUR Signature Events with increased purses, the RBC Heritage has gone from strength to strength and attracts the world’s best players. With the likes of Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy and Max Homa, and avid fans from around the world, the RBC has become a tradition in the golfing calendar. Who will take home the Sir William Innes Champions Trophy and iconic plaid jacket? Buy your 2025 RBC Heritage package and be there to find out! Shortly after the phenomenal Harbour Town Golf Links was built, Sea Pines developer Charles Fraser announced in 1969 that the course would be home to a new PGA TOUR tournament – Heritage Golf Classic. Legendary golfer Arnold Palmer went on to win the first year, drawing a great deal of press coverage. Hilton Head Island now owes much of its esteemed golfing reputation to the continued success of the tournament. Former winners here include the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Nick Faldo, Tom Watson, Fuzzy Zoeller, David Love III, and many more! Renamed to RBC Heritage in 2012, it is now bigger than ever with over 100,000 golf enthusiasts making the trip to watch the biggest names in golf battle it out on the fairway. In 2023, following a restructure to the PGA TOUR, the RBC Heritage became one of eight new PGA Tour Signature Events with limited field sizes and elevated purses. This means that the tournaments attracts more bigger names than ever before. Interestingly, RBC Heritage has a unique tradition to kick off the tournament. After parading around Harbour Town Yacht Basin, the previous winner will be given their Captain of Gentlemen Golfers plaque and then hit a golf ball into the Calibogue Sound using an authentic hickory club. A nod to the history of the game! Recent RBC Heritage history\n",
      "2024 - The man in form, Scottie Scheffler stormed home to a three stroke victory to make the 2024 RBC Heritage his fourth win of the season. 2024 saw the star-studded leaderboard of Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Rory Mcilroy... and we expect more of the same in 2025! 2023 – Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick won the iconic plaid jacket and career-high winnings after he fended off the defending champion Jordan Spieth when he birdied the third playoff hole. 2022 – Fan favourite Jordan Spieth took home the spoils in 2022 following a tight playoff win against fellow American Patrick Cantlay. With the help of both Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus, famous golf architect Pete Dye created the iconic layout that is Harbour Town Golf Links. Opened in 1967, this course set the standard for the quality of golf on Hilton Head Island. The 18th is one of the most well-recognised holes in the world, with the iconic red and white striped lighthouse and the harbour providing an enchanting backdrop for the final hole of the course. The tricky layout provides a challenge for players of all levels, even the tour pros. With small greens that demand precise shots and strategic play alongside the strong winds the island is known for, this course is anything but easy. As a spectator, you’ll have a front-row seat to witness golfing history, adding unparalleled excitement to your experience. Watch the world's best players battle it out on one of the most famous holes in golf - the 18th at Harbour Town Golf Links. Extend your tournament experience and play a handful of the best courses in Hilton Head Island and beyond. Hilton Head is one of top golf destinations in the world. At only 12 miles long, the Island has one of the highest density of courses worldwide, which makes it perfect for extending your trip. Here are a few of our favorite resorts and golf clubs:\n",
      "Sea Pines Resort - Alongside Harbour Town Golf Links, there are two other outstanding courses at Sea Pines – Atlantic Dunes by Davis Love III, and Heron Point by Pete Dye, his second golf course on-site. Palmetto Dunes Oceanfront Resort – Another excellent resort on the island, Palmetto Dunes is home to the iconic Robert Trent Jones layout, plus a George Fazio and Arthur Hills design. Expect unbelievable scenery throughout the resort! Oyster Reef Golf Club - Voted the 'Favorite Course of Hilton Head Island', Oyster Reef Golf Club is a superb inclusion in any golf getaway on the island. Created by Rees Jones and spread over 190 acres of low-country landscape, this championship 18-hole golf course is enveloped by abundant greenery, meandering lagoons, and panoramic island views. Kiawah Island Golf Resort - A South Carolina Golf Tour could be the perfect choice if you’re hoping to explore a little further afield. After spending 5 nights in Hilton Head, you’ll head to Kiawah Island where you’ll play numerous courses, including the famous former Ryder Cup and PGA Championship host – the Ocean Course. Speak to our Golf Travel Experts today about creating a custom itinerary to complement your 2025 RBC Heritage experience.

      "In 2025, the prestigious Open Championship returns to the legendary Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. This marks another historic moment following its triumphant return in 2019, where home favourite Shane Lowry claimed a remarkable victory. The iconic links course, which first hosted the Open outside of England and Scotland in 1951, is set to once again be the battleground for golf's greatest players as they vie for the coveted Claret Jug. Golfbreaks offers a range of exclusive packages tailored to your needs, including tickets, accommodation, golf experiences, and more. Whether you're planning a brief visit for Championship Sunday or a full week exploring Ireland's top golf courses, we're here to help you create an unforgettable Open 2025 experience. Accommodation only packages in Belfast for The Open week are also available on request. Be sure to get in touch with a member of our team if you are interested in accommodation only packages. In preparation for The Open 2025, the iconic Royal Portrush course has been redesigned, featuring two new holes. The 7th and 8th holes have been introduced, replacing the 17th & 18th, to accommodate the large crowds—totalling 190,000 at this renowned coastal venue for another thrilling edition of The Open Championship. The new 7th hole, a 592-yard stretch, begins from an elevated tee and spans an area that once encompassed the 5th and 6th holes of the club’s adjoining Valley course. The 434-yard 8th hole presents a challenging tee shot over a chasm, offering a breathtaking view of the historic Dunluce Castle ruins. With Northern Ireland's rugged coastline as the backdrop and the roar of the crowds, The Open 2025 at Royal Portrush promises a captivating atmosphere that will resonate with players and spectators alike, taking the Open Championship experience to unprecedented heights. In 2019, The Open triumphantly returned to Northern Ireland after a 68-year hiatus, marking a historic moment in golf. The world watched in awe as Irish golfer Shane Lowry delivered an extraordinary performance, finishing at -15 and setting a new course record. His victory was a testament to his exceptional skill, composure, and determination, as he navigated the challenging links with finesse. As anticipation builds for Royal Portrush in 2025, golf fans can also look forward to The Open returning to Royal Birkdale in 2026, followed by the iconic Old Course at St Andrews in 2027—both set to provide unforgettable moments on golf’s grandest stage.

      "For sports fans, nothing can match the thrill of watching a Ryder Cup live - a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should not be missed. After a sensational European victory in Rome, Team USA will be seeking revenge on home soil which is sure to be another thrilling contest. In 2025, the Ryder Cup travels to the world-renowned Bethpage State Park, becoming the second-ever New York course to host this prestigious event. Stay in the centre of New York City at The Lexington Hotel, located just around the corner from Grand Central Station. Our unbeatable 2025 Ryder Cup packages give you the perfect opportunity to combine an epic tournament experience with a city break in The Big Apple. The Ryder Cup is globally renowned as one of the most competitive matches in sport and to watch this historic event live is an opportunity not to be missed. The best of the best are put to the ultimate test in a match that demands pure determination, skill and devotion to the game. They play not for the money, but for the love of the game and competitive spirit. Although the players put on an unforgettable performance, the crowd is what makes the Ryder Cup so special, and you can be part of the action in 2025. Grandstands and big screens are scattered across the course as well as spectator villages. The buzz amongst the galleries is electric – and you certainly don’t have to be a golfer to appreciate this! When it comes to crowd engagement, nothing can compare to the Ryder Cup, with the match-play format creating the kind of competition and atmosphere you simply can't find at other sporting events. With enthused crowds, eccentric fan attire, and extreme pressure on matches, there are so many reasons to go to the Ryder Cup! Golf at Bethpage State Park has a rich history, first opening it's doors back in 1936. It has since hosted the U.S. Open Championship in 2002 later returning in 2009 and the PGA Championship in 2019. The Black Course is renowned for being extremely difficult proven in 2002 with Tiger Woods being the sole player to finish under par in the U.S. Open Championship. The 90-hole complex is situated less than an hour from the centre of New York City where the 7,468-yard Black Course lies. The course is considered to be one of the top 100 courses worldwide and is even open to the public. The New York area is known for having some of the rowdiest golf fans which will be sure to make this an entertaining and unforgettable clash. Stay in the centre of this vibrant city and experience its diverse culture and breathtaking skyline. Travel to and from the Ryder Cup via Grand Central Station. Celebrate with other fans and soak up the lively Ryder Cup atmosphere. The Ryder Cup is now regarded as one of the greatest sporting events on the calendar. Samuel Ryder, from whom the cup gets its name, was inspired by the 1926 match at Wentworth when Abe Mitchell teamed up with George Duncan to defeat the great Open champions, James Barnes and Walter Hagen. In the bar after the game, Ryder declared ‘We must do this again’, and the rest is history... When officially introduced in 1927, the two teams competing were originally Great Britain and the United States. The US got off to an impressive start, winning the first five Ryder Cup competitions. This dominance continued both before and after the Second World War, which led to the inclusion of European players in 1979, where the playing field became a lot more even. In recent years, the Ryder Cup has brought to our screens some of the most memorable displays in the cup’s history. Many of you will have witnessed the ‘Miracle of Medinah’ in 2012, the United States' brilliant display at Hazeltine in 2016, and Europe’s demolition job at Le Golf National in 2018. Needless to say, the trend over the past decade has been a back-and-forth tussle with each team winning on their home soil for the most part. In 2025, Team USA will be looking to get payback on home soil following another one-sided defeat at Marco Simone Golf & Country Club in Rome. Will they hit form like they did in Whistling Straits or will we see Europe continue their fine form? One thing is for sure, there is no way to experience it quite like being there in person! The Ryder Cup provides three days of intense match-play formats, including foursomes x2, fourballs x2, and singles matches. The first two tournament days offer exhilarating pairs matchplay with 16 points up for grabs, before heading out for singles on the final day. With 12 points available, everything can change on the final day which makes for an incredibly exciting format with crowds roaring in every corner of the course. Wednesday 24th September\n",

      "Spain offers a myriad of semi all-inclusive golf holiday options, particularly in the Costa de la Luz at the western point of Andalucía. Precise Resort El Rompido and Barcelo Montecastillo Golf are two fantastic five-star resorts with golf courses, multiple restaurants and bars, spa facilities, and much more all under one roof. Moving along the coast to the east, there are also plenty of venues available in both Alicante and Murcia. In Murcia, La Torre Golf & Spa Resort is a luxurious five-star resort that offers access to Murcia’s many courses, as well as its own layout on-site. Similarly, Hotel Bonalba Alicante is a fantastic all-encompassing resort just 20-minutes outside of the city centre – a great location to enjoy your next golf holiday. As with Spain, Portugal is a hotbed for UK golfers. The Algarve provides the setting for some of Europe’s leading courses and resorts, with Albufeira becoming the ideal location for golfers after semi all-inclusive convenience and good nightlife. Sao Rafael Atlantic is one of our most popular hotels in the area, with five-star elegance, a collection of bars and restaurants, and a large spa. Visitors will also have easy access to two of the area’s most beautiful courses – Salgados and Morgado de Reguengo. Further inland, Morgado Golf & Country is another fantastic golf resort. Here guests will have access to two golf courses and exceptional four-star facilities. Discover top-class resorts with golf on-site and everything you would need all under one roof\n",

The Women’s Golf Hub by Golfbreaks was launched in 2024 as a way to support the growing network of women interested in sharing and connecting through their love of golf.

We welcome golfers of all skill levels and backgrounds and love to see members exchanging tips, arranging meet-ups and celebrating achievements. Whether you're a seasoned player or going to the range for the first time, our community offers a supportive environment where every golfer is valued and every journey celebrated.

The resort is situated in Catalunya, between Girona and Barcelona, which is the perfect location for your net European golf holiday. West Cliffs\n",
      "Located on-site of the impressive Praia d’Ely Rey Resort outside of Lisbon, West Cliffs is one of the world’s best new golf courses. Cynthia Dye (Pete Dye’s niece) laid out a true modern masterpiece that sits elegantly along the silver coast featuring rolling sand dunes and coastal vegetation. Plus, with breathtaking views of the Atlantic Ocean from every hole, West Cliffs offers a unique links experience in a pristine natural environment. Thracian Cliffs\n",
      "The tremendous Thracian Cliffs is Europe’s answer to Pebble Beach. The designer, Gary Player, famously said “You will not find another golf course like this anywhere on the planet”, and its impossible to disagree with him. The course is set along the cliffs of the Black Sea, offering spectacular views and a truly memorable golfing experience. Each hole is a visual feast, with the sea in play on most holes, creating a thrilling challenge for golfers. Chateau Course, Terre Blanche\n",
      "One of our most luxurious offerings nestled in the picturesque hills of Provence, southern France, lies Terre Blanche. There are two exceptional layouts here, with Dave Thomas’ Chateau Course the more acclaimed of the two. Spanning over 300 hectares, the Chateau is meticulously integrated into the rolling landscape with expansive views of the surrounding villages and the distant Southern Alps. Europe is a historic continent filled with many unique cultures and stunning landscapes, so no matter where you go, there is so much for you to explore off the course. Portugal\n",
      "Portugal has long been a popular choice for holiday makers and is continually evolving, especially when it comes to the golf. The Algarve is where golf holidays began, and it remains one of Europe’s leading golf destinations. More than 3 golf courses populate this stretch of stunning coastline, with a range of accommodation types on offer from luxury hotels to villas and apartment. From the authenticity of Lagos to the nightlife hotspots of Vilamoura and Albufeira, there really is so much variety in this corner of Portugal. Elsewhere in Portugal, what Lisbon lacks in quantity it more than makes up with quality. The rugged coastline sets the scene for a more rugged, links style of golf – which goes against the typical vision of Portuguese golf. Combine this with a cosmopolitan city centre for a golf break that ticks every box! Spain\n",
      "As with Portugal, a lot of the guaranteed weather and high proximity of golf courses is based in the southern area of Spain. The Costa del Sol is possibly the biggest golf destination in Europe with more than 70 courses dotted around towns such as Marbella, Sotogrande, and Malaga. Murcia is another popular location with over 300 days of sun a year and a collection of the countries best-selling golf resorts. Elsewhere on mainland and on the Balearic Islands, golfers can enjoy fantastic golf & city breaks at the likes of Sevilla, Palma, and Barcelona. France\n",
      "Outside of the UK and the US, France might be home to more top courses than any other country in the world. Its varied landscapes make for a whole host of courses - links, inland links, woodland, heathland, parkland… France has the lot! It is also incredibly easy to get to, with Le Shuttle for the north and short flights for the south. Add to this the famous, culture, food and wine for one of our best all-round golf holiday experiences. Turkey\n",
      "Golf in Turkey is very much centred around Belek (Antalya), which is well regarded as the home of all-inclusive golf. Here lies a stunning coastal resort town with miles of beaches, huge all-inclusive resorts, and a delightful blend of first rate golf courses within close proximity to one another. Colin Montgomerie and Sir Nick Faldo are just a few of the names that have contributed to the Belek golf scene in the last 20 years, creating a true holidaymakers dream. Italy\n",
      "Golf and Italy have become synonymous with one another since Team Europe’s victory at the 2023 Ryder Cup. Before then, Italy’s reputation was underappreciated despite the DP World Tour (European Tour) visiting here every year since 1972. The variety of destinations is unrivalled worldwide, with countryside retreats, city centre stays, and luxurious island retreats. Add to this the famous food and wine for a remarkable getaway. Elsewhere in Europe, we offer an incredible blend of exciting, culturally rich, and golf crazed destinations. Belgium is easily accessible via Le Shuttle and is a great alternative to France, with some superb options located around Bruges and Brussels. Greece and Cyprus are two top-tier nations that do an exceptional job of blending sun-kissed golf in a luxurious setting, while Norway and Bulgaria provide the most dramatic and scenic golf imaginable.

From the tranquil shores of the Kent coastline to the livelier locations of Bournemouth and Birmingham, we include just a few of England’s best golf destinations below:\n",
      "Southport\n",
      "Located at the heart of England’s Golf Coast (North West England), which runs from Blackpool down to Liverpool, the town of Southport is one of the leading golf destinations in the world. Within a 5 minute drive of the town centre, golfers can travel to the likes of Royal Birkdale, Hillside, and Southport & Ainsdale – three fantastic, but very different links courses. Slightly further away sits two other Open Championship venues in Royal Lytham and Royal Liverpool, with some other lesser-known top 100 layouts such as West Lancs, Wallasey, and Formby also within easy driving distance. Add to this a great nightlife and Southport ticks every box. Bournemouth\n",

The town centre is packed with restaurants, bars, and clubs, and the long sandy beach is perfect for a day off the course.

Broadstone, Parkstone, Ferndown, and Isle of Purbeck are all Heathland classics, with the woodland layout at Remedy Oak also making a fine addition to any golf tour. Kent\n",
      "Located in the southeast of England, Kent is home to some of the most picturesque golf courses in the country. The 15-time Open Championship venue of Royal St. George's is the pick of the bunch and is often regarded as the best courses in England. The course is set on the Kent coastline in Sandwich Bay and features challenging bunkers, rolling fairways, and undulating greens. Also idyllically situated along the Bay sits Prince’s Golf Club and Royal Cinque Ports.

      "1. Royal County Down (Newcastle, Northern Ireland)\n",
      "Ranked among the world's top 3 layouts by Top 100 Golf Courses, Royal County Down offers a stunning layout set against the backdrop of the Mourne Mountains. Designed by Old Tom Morris, this course is renowned for its fast greens and challenging blind shots. It has hosted prestigious tournaments, including the Irish Open. Ballybunion Golf Club (County Kerry)\n",
      "Once described by Tom Watson as \"the course on which many golf architects should live and play on before they build golf courses\", Ballybunion's Old Course is one of the purest links experiences in the world. The course’s towering dunes, unpredictable winds, and undulating fairways make it both a scenic and strategic challenge. Royal Portrush (Portrush, Northern Ireland)\n",
      "The only Open Championship host outside of mainland Britain, Royal Portrush is well located in the Causeway Coast & Glens area of outstanding natural beauty. This world-famous links course boasts stunning coastal views, rolling dunes, and challenging holes that test even the best golfers. Gary Player once said \"I don't think there's a better golf course ever chosen for The Open\", and it is hard to disagree with him. Lahinch Golf Club (County Clare)\n",
      "Often called the \"St. Andrews of Ireland,\" Lahinch Golf Club offers a historic links course known for its unique design and unpredictable weather conditions. It provides an exhilarating test of skill with spectacular views of the Atlantic Ocean. In 2019, Lahinch was the host of the 2019 Irish Open where a fresh-faced John Rahm took home the trophy. Portmarnock Golf Club (Dublin)\n",
      "Situated on a picturesque peninsula 15kms outside of Dublin, Portmarnock Golf Club has a rich history of hosting professional tournaments, including the Irish Open. It offers a classic links experience with firm fairways and strategically placed pot bunkers. Other fantastic Ireland links courses include; Tralee, Waterville, The Island, Castlerock Golf Club, Rosapenna, European Club, and many more! While links golf is undoubtedly the main event when it comes to golf in Ireland, there are also some exceptional inland layouts to enjoy for larger groups. For a five-star stay & play experience, we'd recommend Adare Manor (Co. Limerick), the 2028 Ryder Cup host, Mount Juliet (Co. Kilkenny), and The K Club (Co. Kildare) - home of the 2006 Ryder Cup and multiple Irish Opens. Ireland is truly magical when it comes to bucket-list golf travel, from the stunning natural links to the beautiful scenery, the emerald isle is a popular destination and it's clear to see why. A plethora of golf awaits you, and there is a great selection of hotels just outside of the big cities as well as golf resorts so you can choose between staying in one place or experiencing the culture while drinking a Guinness. The golf season in Ireland typically runs from April to October, with the summer months (June–August) offering the best conditions. Spring and early autumn are also excellent times to visit, as courses are less crowded and the weather remains mild. Here are some top tips to consider when booking a golf holiday:\n",

In addition to Greg Norman, Robert Trent Jones Jr has also contributed greatly to Vietnam’s golfing rise with his delivery of Hoiana Shores. This iconic layout is set within a UNESCO World Heritage Site Known as The City of Lanterns, south of Da Nang (nearby BRG Da Nang). The course plays like any great Links and has been likened to classic Scottish courses, playing firm and fast, with rolling fairways and sand dunes. In the northern region, near Hanoi, the Kings Island Golf Club is the perfect example of first-class resort golf and even boasts a Jack Nicklaus II design. Open today 8am - 7pm\n",

      "Southeast Asia is famous for hospitality with its kindness and giving approach, and Vietnam is no different. Whether you’re staying in a family-run bed & breakfast or in five-star luxury, first-class service can always be expected. From Silk Path Hotel in Hanoi to Bay Hotel in Ho Chi Minh, we offer very good hotels at amazing value. Plus, with Vanda Hotel in Da Nang and TTC Hotel Premium Michelia in Nha Trang, your hospitality needs are well and truly taken care of to fully explore the best of Vietnam. Throughout the country, you’ll find varied cuisine with local food and fresh produce specific to each individual region. Given its proximity to other countries, there are strong Chinese and Thai influences, as well as subtle inspirations from France due to the 60-year colonial rule. Food-themed walking tours, cooking classes, and fine dining are all easily found, but visits to the local markets for street food are part of the Vietnam experience and are the best way to fully immerse in the famous food and culture. Keep your eyes peeled for noodle soup (Pho), Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh Mi), Hoi An Noodles (Cao lau), and spring rolls (Cha gio). If your dream golf holiday consists of combining, culture, amazing food, and incredible golf then look no further than Vietnam. With some of the world's best new golf courses, Vietnam is fast becoming the number one golf destination in Asia and it's easy to see why. Vietnam is famous for both its pristine beaches and lively cities, and you can experience both in spades on your next golf holiday. In recent years Da Nang has become a huge tourist attraction with its laid-back atmosphere and friendly locals. And there is plenty to see and do with street food, exploring limestone caves and the marble mountains, Hoi An Ancient Town, and a host of beautiful beaches overlooking the city centre. Likewise, the coastal resort city of Nha Trang is synonymous with beaches, clear water, and vibrant beachside bars. Here guests can explore historic cultural sites such as Po Nagar Cham Towers and Nha Trang Cathedral, as well as exciting boat excursions to visit the many local islands. Away from the coast, Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi, and the historic Ho Chi Minh are two vibrant and cosmopolitan cities to indulge in. Both combine the best of old and new, from temples and pagodas to museums and street food, with plenty of modern accommodation options. For great resort golf and sightseeing, then the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi is perfect. Pair Sky Lake Golf Resort with city living and a day excursion to Ha Long Bay, famous for its iconic limestone pillars. For the best golf courses amongst idyllic surroundings, then Da Nang & Hoi An is the perfect fit. Here visitors can experience a UNESCO World Heritage Site, pristine beaches, and world-class layouts designed by Greg Norman and Colin Montgomerie. In the south, history buffs will enjoy Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon. Vibrant, energetic, and the perfect blend of old and new, this cosmopolitan city is great for top landmarks, street food, and plenty more. Located along the coast which borders the South China Sea, this central Vietnam region offers a selection of superb golf courses. Nestled in the northern region of Vietnam is the capital city of Hanoi. This unique destination offers a selection of outstanding courses. For a southern Vietnam golf tour, there are two destinations which offer the perfect combination of city and sea - Ho Chi Minh & Nha Trang. Discover some of the oldest golf courses in the world on a golf holiday to India. Vast, diverse, deeply spiritual and utterly unforgettable, India is unlike anywhere else on earth – a melting pot of ethnicities and religions, a treasure trove of history and culture, and a curious mixture of chaos and serenity. This unique golfing destination is nothing short of magnificent. During your India golf holiday, you will play the very best courses the country has to offer. DLF Golf & Country Club\n",
      "Ranked as the number one course in India and 77th in Asia, DLF Golf & Country Club is not one to be missed. Designed by famous golf architect Gary Player, this layout that winds around two lakes will truly test your game. With an island green and dramatic scenery, this is an unforgettable course. Delhi Golf Club\n",
      "Next up is one of the most difficult designs, the Lodhi Course at Delhi Golf Club, which places second in India's top 100 golf courses. Each hole on the championship design has been named after a bird, though you'll be glad to make par on most holes. The course is decorated with narrow fairways which demand accuracy alongside strategically placed bunkers and undulating greens. Even the strongest of golfers will find this course challenging yet incredibly rewarding. Jaypee Greens\n",
      "Designed by Greg Norman, Jaypee Greens was his first Indian golf course design and another stop on the Indian Golf Tour. With numerous lakes and close to 100 bunkers, you are likely to encounter a number of hazards during your round. Another popular golf club in India is ITC Classic, where the Indian Open was first held in 2000. India offers an array of fantastic activities and iconic sights to keep you entertained between your rounds. Of course, it wouldn't be an Indian golf holiday without a trip to see the Taj Mahal. The Amber Fort which overlooks Maota Lake in Rajasthan is also a popular tourist attraction known for its artistic architecture. For animal lovers, a trip to Ranthambore National Park would not go amiss. Situated in southeastern Rajasthan, you can see a great variety of wild animals, including the Royal Bengal Tiger, birds, and reptiles. You could even go the extra mile and attend a Jeep or Canter Safari in the morning or evening. If you're hoping to taste some of the traditional Indian delicacies, then you should certainly dedicate some time to visit Gali Paranthe Wali in Delhi - a famous food lane in Chandni Chowk Market. Here you can try the Delhi-style stuffed parathas which is served in most of the restaurants. Open today 8am - 7pm\n",

      "For a one-of-a-kind experience on your India golf holiday, Khem Villas is the place to be. The 'luxury jungle camp' is set on the outskirts of Ranthambhore and is the epitome of tranquillity. The accommodation is modern yet understated, and you may even see jungle cats, hyenas, and crocodiles within the surrounding grassland. The five-star Trident Hotel Udaipur sits on the banks of Lake Pichola in Udaipur and was awarded the Best Family Hotel by Travel & Leisure India. The hotel aesthetic was inspired by the architectural heritage of Udaipur with a charming twist on traditional decor. With quality service and an unbeatable location, this is a great place to unwind after your round of golf. In the heart of Rajasthan lies the elegant ITC Rajputana Hotel. The grand decor and brilliant amenities are everything you'd expect from a luxury hotel and more. Choose from multiple restaurants serving a variety of cuisines and spend your time off the course by indulging in a treatment at the Kaya Kalp Spa. Additionally, the intricate building architecture echos the traditional havelis of the area and the hotel is also committed to improving sustainability. Stretching across more than 1.2 million square miles, India encompasses a staggering array of landscapes, vistas and environs, not to mention the vibrant, friendly people, and the incredible cuisine. It offers an unparalleled travel experience – from the beautiful beaches of Goa, to the compelling craziness of Kolkata.

With over 25 years of experience cementing our core values of choice, value, service and loyalty, we guarantee to provide the best possible service for the 230,000+ golfers we send on our golf breaks, golf holidays and golf tournament experiences each year. Our UK customers can book with confidence and peace of mind, in the knowledge that every flight-inclusive holiday is covered with full ATOL protection and every non-flight package booking is protected by our membership of ABTOT. The ATOL (Air Travel Organisers’ Licence) scheme is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and provides financial protection should we or any of the airlines we partner with suffer liquidation, giving our customers the financial security to book with confidence. Our customers work hard to save up and find the time for their golf breaks, which is why we’re fully covered under ATOL membership number 10374. All of our flight-inclusive packages are ATOL protected and you will always receive a relevant ATOL certificate(s) with your booking confirmation. For more information, visit the ATOL website or look at our booking conditions. The Association of Bonded Travel Organisers Trust Limited (ABTOT) provides financial protection under The Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 for Golfbreaks 5484, and in the event of their insolvency, protection is provided for:\n",
      "ABTOT cover provides for a refund in the event you have not yet travelled or repatriation if transportation was included in your package. The website Golfbreaks.com is owned and operated by Golfbreaks Limited (“Golfbreaks” \"we\" or \"us\"), which is registered with company number 03571913 and has its registered office at Minton Place, Victoria Street, Windsor, SL4 1EG. We are a member of ABTOT (membership number 5484) and have an Air Travel Organiser's Licence (“ATOL”) (Licence number 10374). The booking conditions which apply to your booking will vary depending on the type of golf break you decide to book. We accept bookings for two types of break. (a) The first type of break is a \"UK Hotel Booking\", where you book hotel accommodation with golf in the UK and the golf element is part of the hotel’s facilities, for example the hotel has its own on-site golf course (\"hotel\" in these booking conditions includes hotels, self-catering accommodation and any other accommodation you may book with us). Where golf is an on-site facility of the hotel, this is a service which is intrinsic to the accommodation and so the hotel and golf together constitute a single travel service. Accordingly, these bookings are not packages and are not financially protected. In arranging these bookings, the hotel is principal and we act as an agent for the hotel and we arrange for you to enter into a contract with the hotel. Sections A and B of these booking conditions constitute our agency terms of business when making your booking and you will be bound by the terms and conditions of the relevant hotel as principal. A copy of the hotel terms and conditions may usually be found on the hotel’s website or are available from us on request at [email protected]. (b) The second type of break is a \"Package Booking\", which will include all bookings you make with us other than UK Hotel Bookings. These types of bookings are package holidays and so the provisions (and the financial protection requirements) of the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 (the “Regulations”) will apply and we will accept responsibility for your booking as Package Organiser. It is our duty as the Package Organiser to ensure that you have been provided with all details set out here in schedule 1 before the booking is made. In arranging Package Bookings, we will act as a principal and so your contract will be with us. Sections A and C of these booking conditions will apply to your booking. You should also be provided with all the following information as set out here in schedule 5 which will be provided in the package contract you enter into with us. More information on key rights under the Package Travel and Linked Arrangements Regulations 2018 can be found here in schedule 2. Please read the following booking conditions carefully as you will be bound by them. We recommend that you print off a copy and keep them with your booking confirmation. 1. Accuracy\n",
      "Although all reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of the information (including prices) in our brochures, on our website (www.golfbreaks.com), in our email newsletters and quotes, and in our promotional material and printed media, regrettably changes and errors occasionally occur. We will therefore confirm the details of your chosen break (including the price) at the time of booking. Price and Payment\n",
      "We reserve the right to alter the price of any golf break, not limited to any pricing error, and we will advise you of the current price of the golf break before any booking. Any subsequent reduction in prices due to special offers advertised will not apply to confirmed bookings. A non-refundable deposit must be paid at the time of booking as follows:\n",
      "We will advise you of the amount of deposit required for your break before your booking is confirmed. We reserve the right to ask for an additional amount for certain bookings where we need to pre-pay to the supplier an additional sum to secure your booking, in particular where your booking includes a flight, or for golf tournament tickets. The balance of the price of your break must be paid no later than:\n",
      "Group bookings of 21 and over must pay the final balance no later than 12 weeks before departure for all destinations. Bookings made after the Balance Due Date must be paid in full at the time of booking. If the deposit, balance or final balance (as applicable) is not paid by the Balance Due Date, we, or where we are acting as agent, the hotel, reserves the right to cancel your booking and retain your deposit paid. The cost of your accommodation does not include any services that you may use or purchase whilst at the accommodation other than those specifically included in the price of your break as set out in your booking confirmation. You must pay the hotel directly for such additional services. These may include spa treatments, purchases from pro shops and any meals and drinks not stated to be included in the price of your break. Payment methods\n",
      "Payments can be made online through either our secure customer website portal or in our app portal using both debit and credit cards (including MasterCard, Visa and American Express), or over the telephone through our sales and customer service teams. We also accept bank transfers. There are no surcharges for using personal debit or credit cards, however there is a 2% charge for the use of commercial business cards. We take all reasonable care to ensure our website is secure but, unless we have been negligent, we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data you provide when accessing our website. By entering your payment details, you confirm that the credit or debit card that is being used is yours or that you have been specifically authorised by the owner of the credit or debit card to use it. All credit and debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If your card issuer refuses to authorise payment, we will not be able to process your booking. Booking and Confirmation of Booking\n",
      "You can make a booking for a golf break by either telephoning our Sales office on 01753 752900, sending us an enquiry about a break using our “Enquire Now” button or, for some of our breaks, using our online booking facility which enables you to book and pay online. You must be 18 years or over to make a booking and all bookings are subject to availability. If you send us an enquiry about a break using our Enquire Now service, we will acknowledge receipt of your enquiry as soon as possible and then telephone or email you with availability and any other details you require. If you want to go ahead and book your break, we will take payment over the telephone. For bookings made and paid for online, we will send you an acknowledgement of receipt of your booking request together with a booking reference by email. After we have taken payment, we will then email you (or send by post, if requested) a booking confirmation, which will set out full details of your booking and show any remaining balance to be paid and the date by which it is due (note that full payment is usually taken at the time of booking for online bookings). For Package Bookings, whether by telephone, by email or online, a contract between you and us will only exist when we issue the booking confirmation. For UK Hotel Bookings whether by telephone, by e-mail or online, a contract between you and the hotel will only exist when we issue the booking confirmation. Please check the booking confirmation carefully as soon as you receive it paying special attention to the room type and tee times. Please contact us within 72 hours of receiving the booking confirmation if any information appearing on the confirmation or any other document appears to be incorrect or incomplete, as it may not be possible to make changes later. Group Bookings: Where your booking is for more than one person, the lead name will be responsible for the entire booking. As lead name you guarantee that you have the authority to accept and do accept on behalf of your party the terms of these Booking Conditions. The lead name will be responsible for making all payments due in accordance with the contract; keeping all members of his/her party informed as to the booking details; informing us in writing of any amendments to or cancellations of the booking; and receiving any refunds due for and on behalf of the group and distributing the same among the group. Golfbreaks is not responsible for paying individual refunds to group members. If the lead name booking wishes to transfer the booking to another lead name in the group, lead name must notify us by email to [email protected] of their wish to transfer to the new lead name, together with a confirmation from the new lead name of their willingness to take over the group booking and the responsibilities of lead name as set out in this clause. We shall not be obliged to transfer a group booking to a new lead name if this clause is not complied with. If you have a Complaint\n",
      "If you have a complaint or experience any problems during your break, please inform the hotel or supplier concerned as soon as possible who will endeavour to put things right. If the matter cannot be resolved locally, please contact Golfbreaks by emailing [email protected] or phone 01753 752900 allowing Golfbreaks to assist on your behalf. If you fail to follow this procedure, they (and we) will have been deprived of the opportunity to investigate and rectify your complaint whilst you were in resort and this may affect your rights under this booking. Alternatively, please write to our Customer Services Department at Minton Place, Victoria Street, Windsor, SL4 1EG or [email protected], giving your booking reference and all other relevant information within 28 days of returning home. If we do not resolve the complaint to your satisfaction, we offer dispute resolution services through ABTOT – details in clause 6 below. 6. ABTOT membership\n",
      "We are a member of ABTOT with membership number 5484. As a member of ABTOT we are required to follow the ABTOT terms and conditions of membership. We are able to offer you dispute resolution services through ABTOT in the event that any complaint you make is not resolved to your satisfaction. Please contact us for details of the ABTOT Travel Industry Arbitration Service. Insurance\n",
      "We consider adequate travel insurance to be essential. Details of a comprehensive insurance policy with Staysure that provides additional golf cover, can be accessed via the link on our website. From 29 April 2021 the Staysure policy includes COVID-19 cancellation cover provided you have had all doses of the COVID vaccine that you’ve been offered, including any booster jabs. Staysure Travel Insurance is administered by Howserv Limited which is registered in England and Wales under company number 03882026 and is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) FRN 599282. Staysure is a trading name of TICORP Limited and Staysure Travel Insurance is arranged by TICORP Limited which is registered in Gibraltar company number 111526. TICORP Limited is licensed and regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission number FSC1238B and trades into the UK on a freedom of services basis, FCA FRN 663617. Golfbreaks is exempt from FCA authorisation by virtue of being an Introducer Appointed Representative (IAR) of Staysure. If you purchased your cover before 29 April 2021, you are advised to check your policy documents as to COVID-19 cancellation cover. If you decide not to purchase this insurance, or it is unavailable, you must ensure that any alternative policy you purchase covers as a minimum the cost of cancellation by you or, if you have taken a non-UK break, the full costs that could be incurred in the event of you suffering an accident or illness, including repatriation. You should also ensure that the insurance covers you in the event that you cannot go on your trip by reason of circumstances related to COVID-19 as this will be your responsibility not Golfbreaks. Please note that not all insurance policies intended for travel overseas are adequate to cover you for the UK breaks we feature. It is your responsibility to ensure that the insurance cover you purchase is adequate for your particular needs. We do not check insurance policies. Please read your policy details carefully and take them with you on your break. We do not accept any liability for any possible loss that you suffer as a result of your failure to take out an adequate insurance policy. Special Requests, Buggy Hire and Medical Issues\n",
      "Special Requests: If you have any special requests, you must advise us at the time of booking. Although we will endeavour to pass any reasonable requests on to the relevant supplier, we regret we cannot guarantee any request will be met. Confirmation that a special request has been noted or passed on to the supplier or the inclusion of the special request on your confirmation or any other documentation is not confirmation that the request will be met. Unless and until specifically confirmed, all special requests are subject to availability. Buggy Hire: Availability of buggies is at the discretion of the golf venue. Where you request a buggy, we may, as a courtesy, request this from the venue, but do not guarantee availability. Unless specified as being included with the round of golf, golf buggies are not included in the price of your golf break and do not form part of your UK Hotel Booking or Package Booking with Golfbreaks. Buggies must be paid for at the golf venue. The full cost of the buggy is payable whether or not there is full occupancy of the buggy, or at the discretion of the golf venue. Use of buggies is dependent on the course conditions and weather and may be restricted due to any reason in the golf venue’s absolute discretion. Availability of partial refunds or green fee vouchers are entirely at the venue’s discretion where buggies cannot be used. Golfbreaks is not responsible for any restriction on/inability to use buggies which a golf venue may impose. Medical Issues: If you or any member of your party has any medical issue or disability that may require assistance, please tell us before you book or, if diagnosed after you confirm your booking, as soon as possible after you become aware. If the supplier in question reasonably feels unable to properly accommodate the particular needs of the person concerned, we must reserve the right to decline your booking or, if full details are not given at the time of booking, cancel when we become aware of these details. Where a buggy is required for medical reasons, this is at the discretion of the golf venue and we will ask you to provide any information required by the venue and this may include medical certification requirements. Delays\n",
      "In the event of delays to your transportation, the provision of assistance and refreshments is governed by the individual operator's policy or in the case of flight delays, by UK passenger rights laws. We cannot accept liability for any delays due to arrangements you make for air travel, or any other transportation not booked with us. Where you have booked your flights through us as part of your booking, any payment that you receive from the airline or other third party will be deducted from any compensation that may be due from us (see Section 21(5) below for further details). Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances\n",
      "In these booking conditions, \"Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances\" means a situation beyond the control of the party seeking to rely on such a situation the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. Such events may include, without limitation: war or threat of war, riot, civil strife, actual or threatened terrorist activity, industrial dispute, natural or nuclear disaster, adverse weather conditions, fire, epidemics and pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic current at the date of the publication of these Booking Conditions), airspace closures (as well as other air traffic management decisions which may give rise to long or overnight delays or cancellations of one or more flights). 10A. COVID-19 health and safety measures\n",
      "You acknowledge and agree that the airlines, hotels, golf venues and other suppliers of your booking will need to comply with national and/or local guidance and requirements relating to Covid-19 and have implemented certain measures as a result. This may include specific requirements regarding personal protective equipment, such as use of face-masks by staff and guests, social distancing, maximum number restrictions on the use of certain facilities, designated alternative entrance and exit routes, mandatory hand sanitisation, limited entertainment options and limited food/drink availability. All measures will be taken with the purpose of securing your safety and those around you. We will not be responsible or have any liability for the imposition of such health and safety measures. Data Protection\n",
      "When you make a booking for a golf break, we will need to use your personal data such as name and address to make the travel arrangements for your break and otherwise as necessary to ensure that your booking contract is performed. We may be required to pass your personal data on to relevant third-party suppliers of your travel arrangements such as hotels, airlines, transport providers, ground agents and destination management companies and golf venues so that they can fulfil their part of your travel arrangements. We may also need to provide your personal data to security or credit checking companies, credit and debit card companies in order to take payment for your booking and to regulatory or public authorities such as customs or immigration if required by them, or as required by law. Transfers of your data to our travel suppliers within Europe are permitted under the UK General Data Protection Regulations. Where we need to transfer your data to a third party supplier or service provider based in a country located outside of Europe, in order to fulfil your booking, or for the purposes of the third party providing us with a service, we will ensure that either the country to which the data is to be transferred has an adequate level of protection for data (as determined by the UK Government) or we may use specific contracts approved by the UK Government which give personal data the same protection that it has in the UK. Please contact us if you would like further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the UK. By giving us your health and mobility information you are providing us with your explicit consent to use and share such information with our third party partners for the purpose of fulfilling your booking and ensuring that we can provide you with a safe holiday as appropriate taking into account any special needs that you have disclosed to us. Please see our Privacy Policy for more information on how we may use your personal data. Governing Law and Jurisdiction\n",
      "This contract and any dispute, claim or other matter of any description which arises out of or in connection with this contract is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. The Courts of England and Wales shall have jurisdiction to decide any dispute or claim that arises out of or in connection with this contract, except that you may elect to choose resolution of your dispute under the ABTOT scheme (if the scheme is available for the claim in question) – see Section 6. If you are a resident of Scotland or Northern Ireland, you may choose the law and jurisdiction of Scotland or Northern Ireland instead. Your Contract with the hotel\n",
      "When you make a UK Hotel Booking, we will act as your agent in the booking of your hotel accommodation. Your contract will be with the hotel provider/owner (referred to from now on as the hotel) and their booking conditions will apply, copies of which are available from us. We advise you to obtain and read those. As an agent, we accept no responsibility for the provision of the accommodation by the hotel (including its facilities and services) with whom you have a contract. All hotel accommodation that we provide or that is sold through us is not an offer by us to sell any accommodation, but an invitation to you to make an offer to the hotel. We are authorised to accept that offer on behalf of the hotel or to reject it. Amendment or cancellation by you\n",
      "If once the booking confirmation has been issued, you wish to change your booking in any way or cancel your booking, the person who originally booked the break (the lead name) must notify us in writing by email or post. The hotel may charge the cancellation or amendment charge shown in their booking conditions (which may be as much as 100% of the cost of the booking). Please contact [email protected] or your allocated customer service agent at Golfbreaks prior to confirming your break in order to find out your hotel or golf course’s specific amendment and cancellation policy. In addition, we may incur losses and costs in amending or cancelling confirmed bookings, particularly if such amendments or cancellations occur close to the departure date, and in these circumstances, you will be charged an amendment or cancellation fee reflecting the losses and costs we incur. If you cancel your break or the number in your group booking reduces before the departure date, we have the right to retain the deposit paid by (or due from if still outstanding) each person cancelling as a cancellation fee. If you wish to transfer your UK Hotel Booking to a European venue or vice versa, an amendment fee of £20 per person will apply. Note that all European sales are Package Bookings and so if you transfer to a European venue, Sections A and C of these booking conditions will apply to  booking. Likewise if you transfer to a UK venue, Sections A and B of these booking conditions will apply to your booking. Amendment or cancellation by the hotel\n",
      "In the event of an amendment or cancellation by the hotel, we will inform you as soon as reasonably possible. If the hotel offers alternative accommodation or a refund, you will need to let us know your choice within the time frame stipulated by the hotel. If you fail to do so the hotel is entitled to assume you wish to receive a full refund. Our liability to you\n",
      "Your contract is with the hotel and its booking conditions apply. As agent, we have a duty to using reasonable skill and care in selecting the hotels and in making the booking in accordance with your instructions. We accept no responsibility for the provision of the accommodation (including all facilities and services) by the hotel under the contract or otherwise nor in respect of any information about the hotel that we pass on to you in good faith, except in cases where it is proved that we have breached that duty and damage has been caused to you. If we are found liable to you on any basis, we limit our liability to you to three times the cost of your booking (or the appropriate proportion of this if not everyone on the booking is affected). This limit does not apply to cases involving death or injury. 16A. If your travel arrangements cannot be provided or are cancelled by the hotel due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances, we shall not be liable to pay any refund or other compensation, costs, expenses or any other sums, including the cost of securing alternative accommodation. However, as your agent, we will refund to you any cancellation monies that we receive on your behalf from the hotel. Your Contract with us\n",
      "When you make a Package Booking with us, your contract will be with us. Your package contract includes all the travel arrangements that we make for you including your hotel stay, pre-arranged golf rounds, transport and transfers and any other travel services that are stated on your booking confirmation (see Section 4 “Booking and Booking Confirmation”). You can make bookings for car hire, transfers, airport parking and club hire, as well as purchase foreign exchange, insurance and flights with some leading travel providers using our links to the websites of these providers in the Travel Extras section of our website. Please see our Terms of Use, which apply in relation to the third-party websites listed. Any bookings you make with these providers are made directly with the providers via their websites. They do not form part of your booking with us and are governed by the terms and conditions of the third-party provider which are on the website of the provider or available from the provider on request. We do not have any liability whatsoever in relation to any services that you book with these third-party providers. Price\n",
      "After your booking is confirmed, we may vary the price of your break directly as a consequence of variations in: (i) the cost of carriage of passengers resulting from the cost of fuel or other power sources, (ii) the level of taxes (including VAT) or fees on the travel services included in the contract imposed by third parties not directly involved in the performance of the package, including tourist taxes, landing taxes or embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports and airports; and (iii) the exchange rates applied to your break. No price variation will be made less than 20 days before the start of your break. We will absorb, and you will not be charged for, any increase equivalent to 2% of the price of your travel arrangements, which excludes insurance premiums and any amendment charges. You will be charged for the amount over and above that. If the price variation means that you have to pay an increase of more than 8% of the price of your package, you will have the option of accepting a change to another holiday if we are able to offer one (we will refund any price difference if the alternative is of a lower value) or cancelling and receiving a full refund of all monies paid. If you do not respond to our notification of price change, we shall be entitled to terminate your contract and provide you with a full refund. You may be entitled to additional compensation pursuant to clause 21 if you do not accept a substitute holiday and cancel the contract. Should the cost of your holiday go down due to the cost variations mentioned above that occur prior to the start of the package, then you have a right to a price reduction corresponding to any decrease in such costs. However, please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the price of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place. Cancellations/Amendments by You\n",
      "If once the booking confirmation has been issued, you wish to change your booking in any way (for instance to the numbers of persons in your group booking, transfer your break to another person) or cancel your break, the person who originally booked the break (the lead name) must notify us in writing by email or post. We may incur losses and costs in cancelling confirmed bookings, particularly if cancellations occur close to the departure date, and in these circumstances, you will be charged a cancellation fee reflecting the losses and costs we incur. If you cancel your break or the number in your group booking reduces before the Balance Due Date, we have the right to retain the deposit paid by (or due from if still outstanding) each person cancelling as a cancellation fee. If you cancel on or after the Balance Due Date, we may charge you a cancellation fee which is up to an amount equal to the balance of the price of your break depending on the cancellation costs we incur to our suppliers, how close your cancellation is to your departure date and our ability to resell cancelled bookings. If you have already paid your balance at the time of cancellation, we will be entitled to retain the cancellation amount from the balance paid and will refund to you the difference (if any). Please contact [email protected] or your allocated customer service agent at Golfbreaks prior to confirming your break in order to find out your hotel or golf course’s specific cancellation policy. We will try to facilitate a transfer of your booking to another person provided that we receive 7 days’ notice prior to the departure date and that the person to whom you wish to transfer satisfies all the conditions of the break. We may require satisfactory evidence before agreeing to the transfer. For all amendments and transfers, you will require you to pay any additional fees, charges or other costs arising from such amendment or transfer. You should be aware that these costs could increase the closer to the departure date that changes are made, and you should contact us as soon as possible. In particular, if numbers change so that there is an odd number remaining in the party, single room supplements will apply. If you wish to transfer your UK Package Booking to a European venue or vice versa, an amendment fee of £20 per person will apply. You may cancel your break due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances occurring at the place of destination or its immediate vicinity and which significantly affect (a) the performance of the package or (b) the carriage of passengers to the destination, without liability for cancellation charges. Cancellations under this clause will only be considered close to departure and this provision does not cover you if you have a disinclination to travel due to concerns such as COVID-19 in the destination. 20. Cancellations/Amendments by Us\n",
      "Occasionally, we have to make changes to, and correct errors in, our brochures and on our website both before and after bookings have been confirmed, as well as cancel confirmed bookings. Whilst we always endeavour to avoid changes and cancellations, we must reserve the right to do so. However, we will not cancel your booking after the Balance Due Date, except due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances (as defined in Section 10) or failure by you to pay the final balance by the Balance Due Date. Most changes are minor and we will advise you of them at the earliest possible date. Occasionally, we have to make a \"significant change\" and we will tell you of any such change as soon as reasonably possible. If we make a significant change to your break or cancel your break, we will offer you the choice of the following options:-\n",
      "In addition, if we have to make a significant change to or cancel your booking, we will pay you additional compensation, if appropriate. However, additional compensation will not be payable where we are forced to make a significant change or cancel as a result of Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances (as defined in Section 10) including (but not limited to) in the case of a significant change arising due to circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic; if we cancel as a result of your failure to comply with any requirement of these booking conditions entitling us to cancel (such as paying on time); or if we state in the contract that a minimum number of persons is required in order to operate the break and we do not reach that minimum number within the period specified. Where we are forced to cancel or make a significant change or cancel your trip due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances and you elect to have a refund, it may not always be possible to pay this to you within the time limit required by the Regulations where a high volume of bookings are affected, such as due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, wherever possible we will pay refunds to you without undue delay. Any amendment or cancellation fees you incur in terms of other agreements you have made with other providers under separate contracts are not claimable from us. If any air arrangements included in your booking with us are altered due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances (as defined in Section 10), we reserve the right (where possible) to re-book you and any other members of your group on a suitable alternative flight or air carrier. We cannot guarantee that the routing or type of aircraft utilised will be the same as originally booked. Golf clubs and golf courses may either close the golf course or operate temporary tees and greens at their sole discretion as a result of adverse weather conditions. Please see the Inclement Weather policy on our website which is incorporated into these Booking Conditions and forms part of your contract. 21. Our Liability to You\n",
      "(1) We promise to make sure that the travel services comprising your package that we have agreed to make, perform or provide as applicable as part of our contract with you are made, performed or provided with reasonable skill and care. This means that, subject to these booking conditions, we will accept responsibility if, for example, you suffer death or personal injury or your contracted booking arrangements are not provided as promised or prove deficient as a result of the failure of ourselves, our employees, agents or suppliers to use reasonable skill and care in making, performing or providing, as applicable, your contracted booking arrangements and, in the case of your contracted booking arrangements not being provided as promised or proving to be deficient, that this has affected your enjoyment of your break. Please note it is your responsibility to show that reasonable skill and care has not been used and that your enjoyment of the break has been affected if you wish to make a claim against us. You must also notify us without undue delay of any lack of conformity that you perceive during the performance of your package travel contract. In addition, we will only be responsible for what our employees, agents and suppliers do or do not do if they were at the time acting within the course of their employment (for employees) or carrying out work we had asked them to do (for agents and suppliers). (2) We will not be liable to pay compensation for any injury, illness, death, loss (for example loss of enjoyment), damage, expense, cost or other sum or claim of any description if we prove that the lack of conformity claimed is:\n",
      "However, in these circumstances, we will still provide you with prompt assistance if you are in difficulty (see sub-paragraph (8) below). (3) We do not accept responsibility or liability for any services which do not form part of our contract with you. This includes, for example, any additional services or facilities which your hotel or any other supplier agrees to provide for you where the services or facilities are not advertised on our website or in any of our brochures as being included in the price of your break and we have not agreed to arrange them. This also includes services that you have purchased or booked with a third-party provider through the Travel Extras section of our website. (4) The promises we make to you about the services we have agreed to provide or arrange as part of our contract, and the laws and regulations of the country in which your claim or complaint occurred, will be used as the basis for deciding whether the services in question were properly provided. If the particular services which gave rise to the claim or complaint complied with local laws and regulations applicable to those services at the time, the services will be treated as having been properly provided. This will be the case even if the services did not comply with the UK laws and regulations that would have applied had those services been provided in the UK. The exception to this is where the claim or complaint concerns the absence of a safety feature, which might lead a reasonable customer to refuse to take the break in question. (5) Our liability, except in cases involving death, injury or illness, shall be limited to a maximum of three times the cost of your booking. In addition, where any claim or part of a claim (including those involving death or personal injury) concerns or is based on any travel arrangements (including the process of getting on and/or off the transport concerned) provided by any air, sea, rail or road carrier or any stay in a hotel, the maximum amount of compensation we will have to pay you will be limited in accordance with:\n",
      "(a) the contractual terms of carriage of the companies that provide the transportation for your break (and such terms are incorporated into this contract); and (b) any applicable international convention, for example, the Montreal Convention in respect of travel by air, the Athens Convention in respect of travel by sea, the Berne Convention in respect of travel by rail and the Paris Convention in respect of the provision of accommodation, which limit the amount of compensation you can claim for death, injury, delay to passengers and loss, damage and delay to luggage. We are to be regarded as having all benefit of any limitation of compensation contained in these or any conventions. Copies of the contractual terms of the suppliers of your break and the applicable international conventions are available from us on request. Under passenger rights laws, in the event of denied boarding, cancellation or delay to your flight after you have checked in, you may be entitled to compensation from your airline. Full details will be publicised at relevant airports and available from airlines. If you are unhappy with your airline’s response, you may complain to the Air Transport User’s Council (telephone 0207 240 6061). Note that this will not automatically entitle you to a refund of your holiday cost from us -  your right to a refund and/or compensation from us is set out in these booking conditions. If any payments to you are due from Golfbreaks, any payment made to you by your airline or third party will be deducted. (6) We do not accept any liability for any damage, loss, cost, expense or other sum(s) of any description which (a) on the basis of the information given to us by you concerning your booking prior to our confirming it, we could not have foreseen you would suffer or incur if we breached our contract with you and (b) did not result from any breach of contract or other fault by ourselves or our employees or, where we are responsible for them, our suppliers. Additionally, we do not accept liability for any business losses, including loss of profit. (7) You must provide us and our insurers with all the assistance that we may reasonably require. You must also tell us and the supplier concerned about your claim or complaint (see Section 5 “Complaints” above). If asked to do so, you must transfer to us or our insurers any rights you have against the supplier or whoever else is responsible for your claim or complaint (if the person concerned is under 18, their parent or guardian must do so). You must also agree to co-operate fully with us and our insurers if we or our insurers want to enforce any rights which are transferred. (8) Where you are in difficulty during your break, we will give you prompt assistance without undue delay, even if caused by Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances, in particular by, providing appropriate information on health services, local authorities and consular assistance; and assisting you to make distance communications and helping you to find alternative travel arrangements. (9) You may be entitled to the cost of necessary accommodation pursuant to and in accordance with the limits set out in the Regulations where we are unable to ensure your return because of Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances. Any entitlement to receive any such payment from Golfbreaks shall be offset by any payment made to you by your airline or third party. (10) Covid-19: Limitation of liability\n",
      "Without limiting the application of any of the previous provisions of this clause 21, we shall have no liability for any refunds, compensation, costs, expenses or other losses of any kind incurred by you (including, where applicable, the cost of medical treatment) in the following circumstances:\n",
      "(a) if you, or anyone in your booking party, tests positive for Covid-19 within 14 days of your departure date and is not permitted entry into the destination for your booking, we will offer you the following options:\n",
      "If this happens whilst you are on your holiday, please notify us without delay and we will provide such reasonable assistance as we can in the circumstances. However, we will not be responsible for covering the cost of any curtailment of your holiday, missed transport arrangements, additional accommodation required, or other associated costs incurred by you. You must ensure you have travel insurance which covers these costs for you. (b) You or anybody in your party fails any tests, checks or other measures imposed by a supplier, airline, port or airport, border control authority or other government body or local authority or fail to submit for testing or assessment when requested to do so, and as such you are denied entry to board the flight, entry to the destination, access to the services or you are otherwise unable to proceed with the holiday, or that portion of the holiday. 22. Passports, Visas, Health, COVID-19 and entry restrictions\n",
      "We offer guidance on our website on passport and visa requirements for British citizens, including approximate periods for obtaining visas - click here to find out more. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the correct travel documentation for your destination and we do not accept any liability if you are refused transportation by any carrier or entry into any country due to your failure to carry correct documentation. For most of our destinations, if you have a British passport, you will need to have at least six months validity remaining on your passport for many of our destinations (3 months for Europe) and your passport must have been issued within the last 10 years. If you renewed your current passport before the previous one expired and extra months were added beyond its standard 10 year expiry date, be aware that any extra months on your passport over 10 years may not count towards the six months needed. How much time you need on your passport depends on the country you’re visiting. Visit www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice (Entry Requirements section) for further information. Please ensure you allow sufficient time if you need to apply for or renew your passport. HM Passport Office currently advise allowing up to 10 weeks for processing a passport application/renewal. If you or any member of your party is not a British citizen or holds a non-British passport, you must check passport and visa requirements with the Embassy or Consulate of the country(ies) to or through which you are intending to travel. We strongly recommend you check the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office website, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, to help you make an informed decision about travelling abroad. Visit www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice for further information, as well as the FCDO general travel advice at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/travel-advice-novel-coronavirus which provides additional information on travel restrictions and entry requirements in addition to safety and security advice. Please also consult our web page with the latest on coronavirus and how it may affect your break: https://www.golfbreaks.com/en-gb/about/coronavirus-latest-information. Entry requirements may include, but are not limited to, evidence of COVID-19 vaccination, negative COVID PCR or equivalent test taken within a short time before departure, personal health declarations, and declarations giving reasons for travel. Travel advice is subject to rapid change. Countries may change entry requirements and close their borders at very short notice. If destination entry requirements change after you have booked but before your departure date, please contact us to discuss your options. If the destination country for your trip will not allow entry on your departure date, we will be prevented from providing you with your holiday and you will have a right to cancel your trip and claim a refund or we may be able to re-book your trip to an alternative date depending on availability. However, no other compensation will be due to you as the imposition of entry restrictions will be a reason outside of our control and so comprise an Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstance. You may also be entitled to a refund if you are required to quarantine on arrival in destination if this causes a significant change to your holiday, provided that this is a new requirement that arises after you book. You are also entitled to cancel your trip and claim a refund if your break is departing imminently and the FCDO has advised against travel or against all but essential travel to the destination country for your trip and this is current at your departure date, but you are not obliged to do so. You are not entitled to any other compensation. Please contact us so that we might have the opportunity to rearrange your booking in this event. Please note that you have no right to cancel due to being reluctant to travel; only a change in the FCDO advice as previously indicated will give you such right. At the time of publication of these Booking Conditions, there are no restrictions on entry into the UK when you return from your break. However, changes to UK entry requirements may change and you should keep up-to-date on Government guidance. In any event, UK entry restrictions do not affect the delivery of the trip itself: we are not responsible and you are not entitled to a refund or any other compensation from us if you wish to cancel your trip due to UK entry restrictions. We may able to cancel or rebook your trip at your option, but our usual cancellation/amendment fees will apply. If there are changes to the UK entry requirements while you are away on your trip and you wish to return home earlier than planned, we will provide any appropriate assistance that you need, however all associated travel costs are your responsibility. We are only responsible for returning you to the UK earlier than planned if the FCDO advises British nationals to return to the UK. Health requirements for travelling abroad change, and you should check the up-to-date position in good time before departure by visiting the travel advice section on the Department of Health’s website https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/ or by checking with your GP, practice nurse or travel health clinic. We can advise you on any compulsory health requirements if you are travelling abroad for your break. Please ensure that you take out comprehensive travel insurance with sufficient healthcare cover, including cover for COVID-19, existing medical conditions and any activities you plan to do. See clause 7 on Insurance. If you are travelling to Europe and have a European Health Insurance Card it will be valid up to its expiry date. If you apply for a card now, you'll get a new UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC) instead of an EHIC. You card will only cover you for medically necessary insurance, so please ensure that you have travel insurance including medical cover for your trip. Costs of quarantine accommodation that may be required locally are not covered by either GHIC or EHIC. Many hotels and golf venues around the world are still operating under COVID protocols to keep their staff and guests safe, which may include social distancing, wearing of masks, reduced availability of facilities and other restrictions which you will be required to comply with as a guest of the hotel or venue. We will advise you of the main COVID protocols (if any) that apply to the hotel and golf venues included in your Package before you book. By making your booking, you accept and agree to comply with all such COVID protocols and your compliance with such protocols during your visit and the impact they may have on your trip will not constitute a change to your trip. We shall have no responsibility or liability for the imposition of local protocols. If you cannot travel because you have COVID-19, or have been told to self-isolate, or you fail a test at the departure airport or arrival airport, Golfbreaks is not liable for this and you should speak to your travel insurer in this regard. 23. Your Financial Protection\n",
      "Flight packages: All the flight packages on our website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. When you buy an ATOL protected flight inclusive package from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on your ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the suppliers are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid to you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable). If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you claimed under the ATOL scheme.

      "You have the legal right to ask us to supply you with a copy of the personal data that we hold about you at any time free of charge. This could include booking information relating to breaks that you have booked through us. Further copies may incur a reasonable fee and also if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive (or we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances).

      "Where we need to transfer your data to a third party supplier or service provider based in a country located outside of the UK, either in order to fulfil your booking, or for the purposes of the third party providing us with a service, we will ensure that either the country to which the data is to be transferred has an adequate level of protection for data or we may use specific contracts which give personal data the same protection it has in UK. All data transfers to the EU are currently permitted by the UK Government as EU data protection laws are deemed adequate to protect UK personal data. We will share your personal data with any member of our group of companies (which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the Companies Act 2006) for internal administrative purposes including the processing of personal data on the basis of being in our legitimate interests to do so. We ensure that our group companies follow the same rules when processing your personal data. These rules are called “binding corporate rules”. If the shares in Golfbreaks or substantially all of our assets are sold to a third party, your personal data may be disclosed to the prospective buyer during the sale negotiations and on the conclusion of the sale will be transferred as a company asset to the third party. This is necessary for our legitimate interests to be able to sell the company or its assets in the future, provided that we take all appropriate steps to keep your personal data confidential and secure at all times in accordance with this Policy and the Data Protection Laws, including requiring the third party to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Other than as previously stated, we will only disclose or share your personal data if necessary to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use, Booking Conditions and other agreements with you, or to protect the rights, property or safety of Golfbreaks, our customers or others.

Policy created under guidance from the International Chamber of Commerce ‘ICC UK Cookie Guide’ Second edition (Nov 2012). The Breakpoints Rewards Programme (the “Programme”) is a rewards programme operated by Golfbreaks Limited (“We”) under which our customers have the opportunity to earn Breakpoints (referred to in these terms and conditions as “Points”) when you make bookings with Golfbreaks.com (each a “Booking”) which can then be redeemed against payments due for future Bookings made with the company. To join the Programme, customers must be aged 18 years or over and must register on one of the Golfbreaks.com websites by filling in their name, address and contact details and providing a confidential password. Only those customers who have registered with the Programme are eligible to earn and spend Points. Customers who have registered with the Programme are referred to as “Members” in these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions apply to the Programme and by registering with the Programme you agree to these terms and conditions. At the time of publication of these terms and conditions, Members shall earn 1 Point for every £10 that they spend on a Booking and 1 Point earned shall be worth 10p when redeemed against a future Booking (see \"Redeeming Points\"below). Fractions of Points cannot be earned. We may change the number of Points to be earned per amount spent and their redemption value at any time at our absolute discretion and without prior notice. Members of the Programme will earn Points on each Booking on a Booking by Booking basis and Points are personal to a Member and cannot be transferred. Points earned for a particular Booking are credited to a Member’s account on or around the day that the Member returns home after that Booking and not before. The Member who is the lead name on the booking confirmation will earn all of the Points for a particular Booking. Points will not be allocated to other individuals named on the Booking. Points cannot be earned when buying gift vouchers. However Members can earn Points when they redeem a gift voucher in payment for a Booking, with the number of Points earned being related to the monetary value of the voucher. Points cannot be earned in conjunction with any other money off or other promotional offer. The Member must choose between earning Points or redeeming the particular offer. Points cannot be earned on corporate golf events or society golf days booked through Golfbreaks.com. The Programme is effective from 1st January 2005, therefore Points can only be earned on Bookings made from that date onwards. Points cannot be earned on Bookings that the Member made and/or travelled on before the date that the Member joined the Programme. Bonus Points for group bookings may be earned in respect to the final number of people who travel on the break, and not the initial group size at the time of booking. We may withdraw Points (including any bonus Points) in respect of any Booking that is cancelled by the Member, provided that the Member may retain Points for any non-refundable deposit or other payments that are retained by us on account of such cancellation. If a Member amends his or her Booking, we will adjust the amount of Points to reflect the total balance paid in respect of the amended Booking. Points can be redeemed as payment or part payment for a future Booking with Golfbreaks.com. Members are required to specify at the time of paying if they would like to redeem their Points and our sales agent will then deduct them from their account. If a Member does not have sufficient Points to pay for the Booking in full, the balance of payment will need to be paid using our normal payment methods. Points cannot be redeemed against the Booking for which they are earned. At the time of publication of these terms and conditions, there is currently no maximum or minimum number of Points that a Member may redeem against any one Booking. We reserve the right to change this at any time without prior notice. The only person that will be permitted to redeem Points when making a Booking is the person whose name the Booking will be confirmed under once the Booking has been made. Points earned but not redeemed will expire after 24 months of account inactivity. Accordingly, in order to prevent Points from expiring you must either earn new Points or redeem existing Points within 24 months from the last time you earned or redeemed Points. Points are not transferable and can only be spent by the person whose account they are credited to. In addition, they cannot be exchanged for cash or any other form of payment. Points can only be earned by individuals and credited to their individual accounts. Joint accounts are not available. We reserve to right to add or remove Points from a Member’s account at any time with good reason, including if Points have been added or taken away in error, with or without the permission of the Member. Periodically we will inform Members by email of the number of Points that they have in their account. We reserve the right at any time and for any reason to refuse registration by a customer with the Programme or to immediately terminate the membership of a customer from the Programme. We will notify the customer of any such refusal or termination. We may alter or amend these terms and conditions or terminate the Programme at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Please check our website regularly to ensure that you have the latest version of the terms and conditions.
